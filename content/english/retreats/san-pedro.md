The Wachuma Ceremony is a real test revealing our capacity for courage, devotion, commitment, faith and surrender. We wiill experience a positive transformation, giving us the capacity to recognize our limitations, and our essence, which is limitlessness. It awakens a connection on new levels of mind, body and spirit by letting go of emotional baggage and physical toxins , revealing your most authentic empowered self to the world. Let go of fear and ego. and discover a deep personal peace and connection to your heart and mother earth.

Special care is given to each participant. The energetic fields of the sacred places will be used for healing, and in the sacred pilgrimage to reach the Wak’a, or Sacred Stone, in faith it will transform us, heal us, and teach us how to perfect ourselves in service to all beings. The whole pilgrimage becomes one prayer, and we offer our totality with our feet and hands, with our breath, and with our heartbeat.

Fire Ceremony
Fire is the element of release and transformation. Fire holds a tremendous power – when we connect with conscious intent, the effects will be immediate. During the ritual we will connect with Tobacco, a master plant known by all native traditions as an amplifier of prayers. (There will be no smoking. Tobacco can be used in many different ways).
