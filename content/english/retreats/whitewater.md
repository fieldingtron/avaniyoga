#### Instructor - Fields Marshall  (To be decided)

I started teaching Kundalini yoga when I was about 19 years old at the University of Virginia and from there is has been many different styles of yoga.  I most regularly practice Ashtanga Yoga.   Although this is a yoga retreat, the main focus is on reconnecting and experiencing nature.  I lived in Chile for over 15 years and explored many river and natural areas and it really doesn't get any better than Futaleufu. You are going to love it.
